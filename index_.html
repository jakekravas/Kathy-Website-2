          My name is Kathy Kravas and I was born and raised in the Chicago suburbs.  My lifelong passion for reading, writing and teaching has led me to form my own tutoring service.  After nearly 15 years teaching junior high language arts in Schaumburg School District 54, I’ve decided the time is right to start my own company where I can provide personalized literacy instruction to junior high and high school students.
          <br><br>
          Unfortunately, our current health situation has caused most schools to drastically reduce in-person academic instruction.  Students learn best with focused, individualized and in-person teaching. Tailored Tutoring Services can help fill any learning voids in reading, writing, __?__ in a safe and supportive environment.

          Building academic confidence and success through individualized support in all areas of literacy. Every student learns differently. The instability of online versus in-person instruction has made students’ ability to learn in an ideal environment challenging. My tutoring service incorporates strategies to match each child’s independent learning needs. Whether your child needs support learning curriculum material, or could benefit from enhanced literacy instruction, Tailored Tutoring Services. -->
